david.stein1@tu-dresden.de (thursday!)

improving map show and explain + show detailed subproblem cut (improving map here)
pyramid instance earlier

cost function explain what works, what not and why do we need this conditions
cost function ~7min with pictures, explain ideas

min, quartal25, median, quartal75, max

Graphs:
    part_optimality(sigma)
    part_optimality(n) (x-axis: n = point size)
    accuracy(sigma)
    accuracy(n)
    runtime(n) (log) (large sigme => no label fixes = worst case) (worst case n^6 complexity ???)
